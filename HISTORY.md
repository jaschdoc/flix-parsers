### v0.1.0

- Initial release.

### v0.1.1

- Fixes compatibility in test suite with Flix 0.34.0 (version 0.1.0 was compatible with a newer version of Flix which is not yet released).

### v0.1.2

*This release is mostly just to fix compatibility with the Flix community build. See [https://github.com/flix/flix/pull/5235](https://github.com/flix/flix/pull/5235)*

- All functions do not carry the last parameter, and instead return a lambda to make the API more readable.
- Includes basic parser combinators so one should be able to write a few useful grammars with the library.

### v0.1.3
*This release is just to fix compatibility with an upcoming version of the Flix packager. See [https://github.com/flix/flix/issues/5134](https://github.com/flix/flix/issues/5134)*
